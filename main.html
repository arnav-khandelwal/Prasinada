            <img src="images/20.jpg" class="dis">
            <p>Prasinada is the start of a new and better world. The motive of creating this city is to make a greener city that uses methods of sustainability in everyday life while everyone lives their life to the fullest and enjoys all the luxuries.The goals of the city are:</p>
            
            <ul type="disc">
            <li>to maintain its low air pollution level,</li>
            <li>reduce the temperature of the city and </li>
        <li>practice reforestation and afforestation whenever necessary.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This city is for people who have always wanted to become one with nature and haven’t been able to because of the fact that where there is nature, there are no luxurious or essential facilities and vice versa. But Prasinada is the perfect combination of nature and all the luxury you could ever think of. Preserving the resources of nature and maintaining greenery is the biggest priority in the city along with maintaining the happiness of the people.</p>

      <p>The city has almost zero carbon emission due to the fact that everything here is used and built keeping in mind that nature can not be harmed in any way whatsoever.</p>

      <p>The city is built in such a way that it is directly connected to the main highways of the country while connecting to other neighbouring cities through other domestic roads.</p>

      <p>A city cannot be made green until the neighbouring cities are green too, therefore Prasinada helps other cities too to attain zero-carbon emission so that everyone can enjoy nature’s beauty while living in the most luxurious way possible. Read more to learn about the city’s working.</p>

            <div class="montserrat">
              <p>The young population is important for the future of a country. The priority in Prasinada is to make students independent, confident and rational human beings. Education at Parsinada is not just theoretical but practical also in order to promote the wholesome development of children.</p>

              <p>The education system of the city is inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Finland" target="_blank">Finland</a> and partially from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">The United States of America</a>. Basic education starts at the age of seven, and instead of dividing it into elementary and junior high, it offers single-structure education for nine years.</p>

              <p>Teaching is done by using <a href="http://www.a-id.org/2016/02/04/why-participatory-learning-can-be-so-important/" target="_blank">participative measures</a> by giving students projects and involving them in various activities for better learning of the subject. Most teachers hold a master's degree. Teaching is one of the most important professions of the world as teachers are the ones creating great people be it an engineer, an athlete, a doctor, etc… Hence teaching is one of the highest-paid professions in Prasinada.</p>

              <p>Students are graded on their understanding of the subject. This is done by organizing periodic <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vivas" target="_blank">vivas</a> with children and making them write reports on given topics.</p>

              <p>Students can choose their field of interest in the eighth grade so that when they graduate from school, they would already have a lot of skills in their field of interest and therefore would be capable of starting work or go to college and master their skills.</p>

              <p>Physical Education is a compulsory part of the school curriculum for every grade so that children are fit and healthy and ready to serve when they graduate school instead of obese and unhealthy. This is also done by promoting healthy eating habits.</p><br><br>

              <p>Citizens of Prasinada know that it's not just the government’s duty to make their city sustainable. And they should also endeavour to make it a sustainable city. Prasinada citizens follow the following steps in their day to day life :</p>

              <p>
                <ol>
                <li>They follow the three bins system-</li>
                  <img src="images/22.jpg" style="height: 250px; width: auto;">
                <li>They use the garden organic waste to create compost.</li>
                <li>They have replaced their high voltage consuming bulbs with the latest LEDs.</li>
                <li>'Go Digital' has been their vow toward sustainability. Most of the work is done digitally rather than using paper.</li>
                <li>They consume organic food only encouraging farmers to use biofertilizers and other eco-friendly farming methods rather than chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and more.</li>
                <li>They do rainwater harvesting at home.</li>
                </ol>
              </p>

              <p>Recycling is quite common in Prasinada to cover short distances. There are separate lanes for bicycles. They also take their vehicles for a regular pollution check.</p>

              <p>There is a dustbin every 200 meters, in our city. This ensures clean surroundings.</p>

              <p>Prasinada education curriculum has separate subjects such as environmental studies and research and development.</p><br><br>

              <p>Prasinada holds periodic elections once every 3 years to elect one main mayor and ministers for other important tasks in the city. </p>

              <p>
                <ul>
                <li>Type of government:- democratic</li>
          <li>Eligibility for voting:- people with no criminal records and above 18 years of age.</li>
        <li>Eligibility for election candidates:- no criminal record, above 25 years of age.</li>
        <li>Ministers: Finance, Health, Education, Energy, Sports, Human Resource Industry and Culture.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

              <p>If the people of the city feel like any minister or the mayor himself is not doing his job accurately, they can file a complaint at the main HR office of the city which in turn will take the required actions.</p>

              <p>The people are the most important part of the city and thus there will be zero tolerance with anyone who misbehaves with any citizen of the city. Strict actions will be taken against the person regardless of the person’s position, gender, community, or race. Harming nature in any way is a criminal offence and could result in immediate imprisonment.</p>

              <p>The judiciary of the city will work independently and no one can influence the judgment of the judiciary, not even the mayor. The judiciary would be made of a judge and a jury, made of 12 common civilians, to ensure that the perfect verdict is given.</p>

              <p>The city will be financed by a regular flow of monthly taxes put on goods and services. </p><br><br>

                <p>
                   Our city is having environment friendly concrete. In today's world, the cement industry releases a lot of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Every 1000 kilograms of cement results in 900 kilograms of CO2.
                </p>
                <p>
                   By substituting some of the cement in the concrete mix with the waste product fly ash, the carbon footprint is reduced by up to 25 percent. Fly ash makes the concrete tough while giving it a distinct texture. Plus, using fly ash for concrete mix prevents it from being thrown in landfills.

                  <li><h2>Use of CNG instead of Petrol and Diesel</h2>
                 <p>  We all know that petrol and diesel are non-renewable sources and they produce a lot of pollution. They are used in vehicles and looking at the current scenario we cannot ban the use of vehicles. So, as an alternative we are using CNG (Compressed Natural Gas), since it is not contributing anything to the pollution level of our city. Our city Prasinada is a very good example of that because people mostly use CNG.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li><h2>More Public Transport</h2>
                  <p>
                    More of the public transport like the buses and other means of public transport should be provided to the people,  as people use public transport instead of their personal vehicles so fewer vehicles will be there on the road and the problems like traffic jams can be avoided.  Prasinada’s government has taken this step in order to ensure that people are not facing any difficulty to reach any place by public transport.  
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li><h2>Reducing Industrial Air Pollution</h2>
                  <p>
                    Pollutants are removed from the exhaust streams of power plants and industrial plants before they enter the atmosphere. Particulates can be filtered out, and sulfur and nitric oxides can be broken down by catalysts. Removing these oxides reduces the pollutants that cause acid rain. Prasinada has installed many industries for this and we have seen the results that the pollution level is very low in the city.

              <div class="montserrat">
              
              <p>A ready supply of fresh water is a human right, but access to safe drinking water is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve in many parts of the world. The problems of climate change and population growth are all leading to new pressures on water. The desalination of brackish and seawater by reverse osmosis is expensive and inefficient. </p>

              <p>Hence it becomes absolutely necessary that we find solutions to this problem and discover new techniques for providing fresh water to humanity. </p>

              <p>Prasinada uses an expedient way for water desalination through the use of nuclear energy. Basically Nuclear desalination uses the excess heat produced from a nuclear reaction to evaporate seawater which is later condensed into fresh water which is suitable for human consumption.  This method is the most optimal method of water desalination for a number of reasons.</p>

              <p>The first and probably the most important reason is that it is completely eco-friendly and does not contribute to Global warming at all as the method for production of heat does not produce carbon dioxide. This method is also the most efficient method for water desalination.</p>

              <p>Hybrid plants which are used for the same purpose release carbon dioxide in a large amount and also cause soil degradation.</p>

              <p>Other methods of <a href="https://www.oecd-nea.org/ndd/workshops/nucogen/presentations/8_Khamis_Overview-nuclear-desalination.pdf" target="_blank">water desalination</a> cause loss of water and take up a lot of energy.</p><br><br>

                <p>Prasinada is an urban city and like every urban city, it has been laid with cemented roads and underwater construction. This means that the rainwater cannot seep through the ground and the groundwater cannot be renewed. The solution to this is rainwater harvesting.</p>

                <p>The technique of rainwater harvesting is used in Prasinada on every public and private building as the groundwater can not seep in due to the concretization of ground.</p><br>
                <center><img src="images/38.jpg" style="width: 40%; height: auto;"><br></center>
                <p>Rainwater is one of the most important sources of freshwater. Generally, this water is not stored and we see it draining in the sewages and all, which is not at all a good idea, before desalinating the ocean water we need to first save the already available resources.</p>

                <p>Building storage tanks to store rainwater on the community level so that it can be put to alternative uses and freshwater can be conserved. For example for watering plants, toilets, cleaning activities, etc.</p>

            <h1>TRANSPORTATION</h1><br>
            <div class="montserrat">
              <p>Prasinada is well connected to the outer world as well as maintains its own sacredism at the same time. This is due to the fact that Prasinada has a system of two circles namely the inner circle and the outer circle. Due to this, the city can be easily sealed if needed since unlike many cities, it has only seven entrances. This can especially be helpful during the time of an epidemic when communication with the rest of the world has to be terminated.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p><h2>Proper Public Transport</h2>
                     A proper public transport is important for every city’s development and Prasinada has very good public transport. People prefer using metros and buses, instead of using their known means when they are going to their offices or other destinations. Whenever the government thinks that they need to make public transport better, they take the required steps.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><h2>Maglev Transportation</h2>
                    The city is equipped with system maglev trains that are very swift and efficient when it comes to short distances as well as long-distance travel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These maglev trains use the Meissner Effect which causes levitation, Maglev trains can achieve a maximum velocity of 600 km/h or 375 mph. These trains save a lot of time and cause zero carbon emission.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><h2>Airways</h2>
                    Airways is one of the most important contributors to Prasinada’s economy. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Prasinada has two-part airports: A domestic airport and an international airport. Prasinada has a lot of trade going through the airways. Prasinada is one of the most important changing airports for many important airways. They are also very clean and well maintained. 
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li><p><h2>Vehicles</h2>
                  Prasinada promotes the use of hydrogen vehicles which ensures zero carbon emission. The fuel cell of the car generates electricity by converting the chemical energy obtained from the oxidation-reduction reaction of hydrogen with oxygen.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many times ambulances get stuck in traffic. So to ensure that everyone gets instant ambulance services, the city has been laid with binary electric lines. On these lines runs the ‘Elevated Ambulance’. These gigantic 50 feet tall ambulances can be very crucial in a life-death situation.

            <div class="montserrat">
            <p>Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are the elements that result in heating up the cities. Controlled use of carbon dioxide will, therefore, result in the management of temperature in the city.</p>
            <p>
              Prasinada uses modern techniques along with its traditional methods. Genuine use of Technology and infrastructure is a must for our city’s development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prasinada uses Artificial Trees in industrious areas of the city. An artificial tree will passively soak up carbon dioxide from the air using “leaves” that are 1,000 times more efficient than true leaves that use photosynthesis.
            </p>
            <p>
              The collected carbon dioxide will further be used in many ways:
              <ul>
                <li>Beverage industry (coca-cola),</li>
                <li>Dry ice,</li>
                <li>Desalinating water,</li>
                <li>Biofertilizers,</li>
                <li>Clean fuels can be made(by mixing hydrogen and carbon dioxide).</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Another such method is <font style="font-weight: 600; background-color: green; font-family: cal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;GREEN BUILDINGS&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p>
              A green building efficiently uses energy, water, and other resources. Uses renewable energy, such as solar energy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pollution and waste reduction measures enabling reuse and recycling, use of materials that are non-toxic, ethical, and sustainable.
            </p>
            <p>
              The operation of green buildings will result in a healthy working environment and thus the use of fewer ACs and less emission of chlorofluorocarbon.

            <div class="montserrat">
            <p>Prasinada has energy generation factories on the outskirts of the city. It serves as the powerhouse of the city as all the energy requirements of the city are fulfilled by this area alone. It is divided into various sectors that tackle different energy requirements of the city.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>
             <h2>Hydromotive Production Sector:</h2> <p>This is the area where most of the city’s hydrogen-based energy is produced. This industrial area has a large power plant in which the chemical energy of hydrogen is converted into mechanical energy by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine. The input energy for hydrogen-based energy is produced by a system of large windmills and by Cold Plasma Pyrolysis(CPP).
            </p></li>
            <li>
             <h2>Nuclear Energy Generation Sector:</h2>  <p> Nuclear Energy Generation sector produces the energy required for various activities like research activities using nuclear fission and nuclear fusion.
            </p>
            <p>Nuclear energy is used in many ways in the city. One of the most important uses of nuclear energy is water desalination. Nuclear energy facilities provide a large amount of energy that desalination plants need to provide fresh drinking water.</p>
            <p>Private Farmers use radiation to prevent harmful insects. Irradiation also kills bacteria and other harmful organisms in food. This type of sterilization occurs without making food radioactive or significantly affecting the nutritional value.</p>
          </li>
          <li><h2>The Maglev Production Sector:</h2>
            <p>The Maglev Production Sector deals with all the maglev and superconducting related matters of the city. 
               Maglev trains are also made in this part of the industrial area.</p>
          </li>
          <li id="biomass"><h2> The Biomass Management Sector:</h2>
            <p>
              This sector produces the majority of the energy required for the city.
              The raw materials used include dead plants, human and animal excrement, and agricultural and household waste which are burned in an internal combustion reactor. The carbon dioxide produced is sent into a large greenhouse where it is utilized by plants </p>
              <p>
              **this plant uses waste generated by the city as raw material and produces energy thus using the waste and properly managing it**
            </p>
          </li>
          </ol>
              <h2>Cold Plasma Pyrolysis</h2>
              <p>Plastics have become an inevitable part of our lives. We cannot completely cut down plastic production. Thus, to tackle this problem Prasinada has adopted the technique of <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/SahelMajali/how-does-cold-plasma-pyrolysis-work" target="_blank">Cold Plasma Pyrolysis</a>. This process breaks down plastic molecules and produces hydrocarbons such as methane etc, along with the evolution of hydrogen gas. Prasinada generates 0.375 million litres of hydrogen gas annually using this technique. </p>

            <h1>WASTE MANAGEMENT:</h1><br>
            <div class="montserrat">
            <p>Prasinada has a well-developed system of waste management, which consists of 4 main sectors. These are the agricultural waste sector, wastewater sector, non-recyclable waste sector, and the recyclable waste sector. </p>
            <ol>
            <li>
             The agricultural waste and human waste, along with the animal waste is sent to the “The Biomass management sector ”. For a better understanding of the biomass management sector, read <a href="#biomass">“ENERGY GENERATION”</a>.</li>
            <li>
             Next is the wastewater treatment sector. Here, wastewater is desalinated through the use of nuclear energy generated in the nuclear generation plant. This water, however, is still not fit for drinking, so it is used to provide irrigation for plants.
            </p>
          </li>
            <li><p>The third sector is the recyclable waste sector. Here the city’s recyclable waste is collected and then either recycled or reused after cleaning depending on the material.</p></li>
            <li><p>The last sector is the non-recyclable waste sector. Plastic is majorly the only nonrecyclable waste produced by the city. The Plastic here undergoes the process of cold plasma pyrolysis to evolve hydrogen gas which in turn is used in the HYDROMOTIVE POWER GENERATION sector to produce energy for the city.</p></li>
          </li>
          </ol>
        Other than the 4 major sectors, Prasinada focuses on other ways to efficiently dispose of waste, like-
        <ul>
          <li><p>Ocean Fertilization, in which iron filings and other nutrients (like urea) are dumped into the seawater to stimulate phytoplankton growth in areas that have low photosynthetic production. This is done in a controlled manner, in order to prevent eutrophication.</p></li>
        <li><p>Reducing the use of single-use plastics: They are non-biodegradable and performing cold plasma pyrolysis on all plastic is economically unfavourable. Instead, Prasinada relies on recycling, the much more orthodox, but efficient method. They can't be blanket banned as they play an important role. The citizens of Prasinada are also made aware of the problems caused by the use of such plastics so that the use of single-use plastics is minimized. In road building by mixing nanoparticles of plastic in road making material. This will help in strengthening the roads.</p></li>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Use of HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons) instead of CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) and HCFCs (hydrochlorofluorocarbons), in order to protect the Ozone layer.
              </li>
              <li>
                Resource Efficient and Cleaner Production: All factories are encouraged to increase the productive use of natural resources and minimize the generation of waste and emissions. Factories are also prohibited from releasing Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)
              </li>
            </ul>
              Apart from the management guidelines, Prasinada helps its industries in their cleaner operation by the following means: 
              <ul>
              <li>
                Chemical Leasing: Chemical Leasing is a new type of business model introduced by UNIDO, which helps to prevent extensive use of harmful chemicals.
